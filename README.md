# Ultralight-SDL-Key-Test

This is a minimal c source to show I cant get the keyboard events working with SDL

Building with Visual Studio but my other program is having the same problem on linux built with gcc

Notes
This is just a test program
Missing error catching
Mixes c/c++
Horrible code dont use
